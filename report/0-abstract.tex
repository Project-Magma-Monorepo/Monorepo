\begin{abstract}
This master project addresses a significant challenge in the Sui blockchain ecosystem: the time-consuming and resource-intensive process of data indexing. Our research reveals that development teams spend approximately 30\% of their project time implementing indexing solutions to access and analyze on-chain data. We introduce two complementary contributions to address this bottleneck: (1) a modular SDK (corresponding to the sui-indexer-modular) that allows developers to specify both the database type and the precise data to extract from specific transaction fields, and (2) a so-called generic indexer (implemented as sui\_indexer\_checkpointTx) that automatically processes all transactions related to a specific package but does not allow the developer to choose the database type or customize the data extraction. Both solutions prioritize data self-custody, allowing teams to run indexers locally or in their own infrastructure. Our implementations significantly reduce the technical barrier to entry for data indexing on Sui, enabling development teams to focus on their core application logic while maintaining full control over their data. Comparative analysis with existing solutions demonstrates the efficiency and accessibility advantages of our approach, particularly for teams without specialized blockchain knowledge or dedicated indexing resources.
